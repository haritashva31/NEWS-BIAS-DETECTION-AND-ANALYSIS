How City of Light changed the Olympics,"Olympic Village

For the first time, athletes in 1924 could stay together at a purpose-built Olympic Village. Built near the Olympic Stadium, the accommodation comprised row after row of small wooden chalets complete with running water, and the site featured a post office, newsagent, bureau de change, hairdressing salon and a restaurant.



Media coverage

The 1924 Games were also the first to be broadcast live on radio. There were 724 journalists officially accredited to cover the Games, mostly coming from overseas, which was testament to increasing popularity and global interest in the Games.

Edmond Dehorter, sometimes referred to as ‘the unknown speaker’ and later as the ‘father of sports commentary’, commentated on the Games for Radio-Paris.

Olympic venues

The 1924 Olympic Stadium later also staged football’s 1938 World Cup final. Several renovations later, the same site will be used at this summer’s Games to host hockey.



Several other venues were built especially for the Games 100 years ago - such as a new aquatics stadium and tennis courts.



The Piscine des Tourelles – which will be used in 2024 as a training venue for swimmers - became the first 50m Olympic pool. Its lanes were marked out by cork floats.



Just two new venues have been built from scratch for 2024 as the City of Light looks to use its existing venues, along with famous landmarks as the backdrop to events. Temporary sporting stages are being erected, including one at the Eiffel Tower which will showcase beach volleyball.



Closing ceremony

The 1924 Games were the first to feature a closing ceremony with similarities to those of today. This involved the distribution of medals to competing nations along with the raising of four flags - those of the International Olympic Committee, France, Greece - who staged the inaugural modern Games in 1896 - and 1928 hosts the Netherlands.



Ireland

Ireland was also given formal recognition as an independent competing nation for Paris 1924, making a debut appearance in an Olympic Games.



Winter Olympics

Sports competitions held in Chamonix between 25 January and 5 February 1924 in association with the Paris Games were later designated as the inaugural Winter Olympics. Athletes from 16 nations competed in the Games across 16 disciplines, spanning curling, bobsleigh, figure and speed skating and skiing.","How City of Light changed the Olympics Olympic Village

Three men accused of defrauding a bursary scheme for university students in South Africa have been granted bail.

The trio were arrested less than a month ago on allegations of funnelling more than 16m rand ($863,000, £693,000) from the finance company KPMG to private bank accounts.

The Palm Ridge Magistrate’s court in Johannesburg set bail at 50,000 rand each.

Fidelis Moema, Lebogang Sigubundu and Trevor Machimana are alleged to have worked together between October 2019 and 2022.

All three are reported to be intending to plead not guilty though they have yet to enter a formal plea.

A brief look at Mr Moema’s professional history shows the 32-year-old worked in human resources at Ford Motors and as a brand ambassador for several businesses including the retail chain Woolworths.

Mr Moema was reported to police following disciplinary proceedings at KPMG.

The case is due to continue on 24 May when state prosecutors say more witnesses may be presented.

Evidence so far about the suspected fraud has come from Mr Moema’s ex-girlfriends, according to National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane.

""The number of people we are looking at might increase. We prefer to wait for the right moment. When we are at the stage to disclose our docket, we will be able to tell how many people have been added to the case.""","Africa Live this week: 15-21 April 2024 EWN Copyright: EWN The trio are accused of syphoning off nearly $1m intended for students Image caption: The trio are accused of syphoning off nearly $1m intended for students

US calls for calm after officials say Israeli missile hit Iran,"Reuters Copyright: Reuters Naqsh-e Jahan Square today, in Isfahan Province Image caption: Naqsh-e Jahan Square today, in Isfahan Province

For now, there’s a sigh of relief, a pause.

Israel’s limited strike, not officially acknowledged, has given space to Tehran. In this grey area, its leaders are casting it as a slap so weak it’s not even clear who did it. They don’t lose face after days of declarations vowing that even the tiniest Israeli invasion would provoke an immediate and harsh response.

Many had predicted Israel would wait until after Passover to retaliate. It appears to have decided it needed to hit sooner, to send a clear signal, just before the holiday starts. It may still strike again, in a different place, with different force, when this period ends.

But as my colleague Jeremy Bowen writes, this crisis really illustrates how badly Iran and Israel understand each other.

This may have been just a warning salvo into the beating heart of Iran, the province of Isfahan with its stunning Islamic architecture but also a nuclear facility, a major air base, the industrial heartland including drone and ballistic missile factories.

This round may be over, for now, but the seething hostility between two regional rivals is not.","US calls for calm after officials say Israeli missile hit Iran Reuters Copyright: Reuters Naqsh-e Jahan Square today, in Isfahan Province Image caption: Naqsh-e Jahan Square today, in Isfahan Province

Iran downplays presumed Israeli attack but vows response to further action,"After months of delay, the House of Representatives is due to vote on tens of billions of dollars in US military aid for Ukraine and Israel.

Both measures have vocal opponents in Congress, and their hopes of passage have hinged on a fragile bipartisan coalition to overcome legislative hurdles.

Debate is set to begin and voting is expected later on Saturday.

House Speaker Mike Johnson's foreign aid proposal provides $60.8bn (£49bn) to Ukraine, $26.4bn to Israel and $8.1bn to the Indo-Pacific region, including Taiwan.

Left-wing Democrats who object to Israel's conduct of the war in Gaza have said that they will not allow the US to continue to be complicit in a human-rights catastrophe. But the Israel aid bill contains $9bn in humanitarian aid, which may help win over some reluctant Democrats.

Lawyers spar during tetchy exchanges at Post Office inquiry,"Before Rodric Williams was sworn in yesterday morning, very little was known about the senior Post Office lawyer and his role in this scandal.

Two days later, what have we learned?

This afternoon focused on the 'strategy' in dealing with the group litigation led by Alan Bates. Was the Post Office trying to drag things out in the hope that the other side ran out of cash? Not true, said Williams.

Did the organisation also try to limit the data it gave to forensic accountants Second Sight? Unclear, but Williams certainly wrote ""less is more"" in an email.

There were more questions about Gareth Jenkins, whose ""expert"" evidence was discredited in 2013. Was he still being used as a ""shadow witness"" after that date? Anyone playing inquiry bingo could guess the answer: ""I don't recall.""

What we know for sure is that Williams takes ""no pride"" in his association with the Post Office. He also thinks it ""fair"" to criticise his current role in a department dealing with sub-postmaster remediation.

That will likely be cold comfort for those victims.

What they want is answers.

How many people knew about the Horizon issues Williams ""missed""? Who else was aware that statements to the media were misleading? Did anyone at senior level approve of not telling sub-postmasters about ""remote access"" and the unreliable Gareth Jenkins advice?

What do GPs think of Rishi Sunak's plan to strip them of sick note powers?,"What do GPs think of Rishi Sunak's plan to strip them of sick note powers? Published 11 hours ago Share close panel Copy link About sharing

Image caption, Dr Mohit Mandiratta said he supports other people taking on fit notes if they are trained

Rishi Sunak has announced plans to trial stripping GPs of their power to sign people off work, as he attacked the UK's ""sick note culture"" in a speech about welfare.

Instead he wants specialist work and health professionals to issue fit notes as part of a broader aim to make sick notes harder to obtain.

Doctors' union the British Medical Association (BMA) said fit notes were carefully considered before they are written and criticised Mr Sunak's ""hostile rhetoric"" on the issue.

Meanwhile Professor Kamila Hawthorne, chair of the Royal College of GPs, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""as a profession we are not against the idea"" because of high workloads but pointed out that issuing fit notes often formed part of a wider consultation with a patient.

BBC News spoke to some GPs to see what they thought.

'It would reduce our workload'

Halesowen-based GP Dr Mohit Mandiratta said he sees people in his clinic every day who need fit notes for medical reasons, and for the majority it's ""wholly appropriate"".

But he says he would support other professionals taking on fit notes as it would reduce their workload.

""It's no secret that general practice is under huge pressure at the moment. I would support other people doing fit notes as long as they are trained,"" he says.

""It's important they are supportive to patients, understand their needs and take a personalised approach.

""The reason people are off work... often has many factors. I would hope it's a personalised process.""

The partner at Feldon Practice explained any plans to get people back into work would need to be based on general practice and required conversations with employers.

Work is ""good for health"", with people who work generally being happier and feeling more fulfilled, he added.

'Not the best way to spend our time'

Dr Chris Jacobs says sick notes are a lot of work for GPs and have become a daily task. It is common for people to see him asking for a fit note at the request of their employer.

""We are not trained occupational health doctors, so it is an added workload that we take on,"" he said.

The Swindon GP does not think passing the job on to other professionals is a bad idea, as long as they are trained to deal with physical and mental health.

""It could benefit primary care in my view, but primary care should still be involved in the discussion,"" he says, explaining it would allow GPs to spend more time focusing on patients' health needs.

""We are a diminishing workforce on a full-time equivalent basis so I don't think our time is best spent [filling in fit notes].""

Anecdotally, he says, he has seen a rise in people suffering from bad mental health in the last five years.

One in four adults and one in 10 children experience mental illness, according to NHS England.

'There are risks removing sick notes from GPs'

County Durham GP Dr Kas Hawes thinks sick notes can be a difficult part of the job. ""We are too busy as GPs,"" she says.

In particular, repetitive requests with little evidence of sickness or efforts to accept help and get better can be difficult to challenge she says, without impacting the relationship with the patient.

But the Day In The Life of a GP author says the risks of removing sick notes from GPs include issues with access to patient records, and whether the adoption of a one-size-fits-all approach to ill health and recovery penalises people already struggling with financial hardship.

""There is a role for more scrutiny earlier with repeat sick notes, but removing them all together for the financial benefit of the government purse is very worrying in how it could affect some of the most vulnerable people in our society,"" she says.

What is a sick note?

Sick notes are officially known as fitness-to-work notes. They are written evidence that your ill health is affecting your fitness for work. A ""fit note"" certifies a patient is sick, confirming a valid reason for staying off work and eligibility for sick pay.

Why would somebody need a sick note?

Employees can self-certify absence due to illness for seven days and in most cases, qualify for sick pay. But if their illness means they need to be absent for longer, they need a fit note to continue to receive sick pay and also to qualify for some welfare payments.

""We are a diminishing workforce on a full-time equivalent basis so I don't think our time is best spent [filling in fit notes].""

Anecdotally, he says, he has seen a rise in people suffering from bad mental health in the last five years.

One in four adults and one in 10 children experience mental illness, according to NHS England.

'There are risks removing sick notes from GPs'

County Durham GP Dr Kas Hawes thinks sick notes can be a difficult part of the job. ""We are too busy as GPs,"" she says.

In particular, repetitive requests with little evidence of sickness or efforts to accept help and get better can be difficult to challenge she says, without impacting the relationship with the patient.

But the Day In The Life of a GP author says the risks of removing sick notes from GPs include issues with access to patient records, and whether the adoption of a one-size-fits-all approach to ill health and recovery penalises people already struggling with financial hardship.

""There is a role for more scrutiny earlier with repeat sick notes, but removing them all together for the financial benefit of the government purse is very worrying in how it could affect some of the most vulnerable people in our society,"" she says.

What is a sick note?

Sick notes are officially known as fitness-to-work notes. They are written evidence that your ill health is affecting your fitness for work. A ""fit note"" certifies a patient is sick, confirming a valid reason for staying off work and eligibility for sick pay.

Why would somebody need a sick note?

Employees can self-certify absence due to illness for seven days and in most cases, qualify for sick pay. But if their illness means they need to be absent for longer, they need a fit note to continue to receive sick pay and also to qualify for some welfare payments.

Quentin Tarantino: Everything we know about his 10th and final film,"In a nutshell, he wants to go out on a high.

Tarantino has spoken many times over the years about his desire to only direct 10 films in his career, including in a 2022 interview with CNN's Chris Wallace., external

""I’ve been doing it for a long time,"" he explained. ""I’ve been doing it for 30 years, and it’s time to wrap up the show.

Can cooking with an air fryer save you money?,"Because an air fryer's fan is more powerful and the compartment is smaller, the whole device is more efficient, says Jakub. ""If I have a chicken thigh, I will probably cook it for 20 minutes in an air fryer. In an oven it would take longer."" Also, it takes longer to pre-heat a larger, conventional oven.

Because an air fryer's fan is more powerful and the compartment is smaller, the whole device is more efficient. Dr Jakub Radzikowski, Imperial College London

However, because the drawer in an air fryer has less capacity, you can only cook smaller amounts. ""If you're cooking for four people or six people the kind of time saving doesn't work anymore because you have to cook in a few batches in the air fryer,"" says the food scientist.

3. An air fryer is great for 'crispy' foods

Marketing images for air fryers often feature chicken and chips. This is because they’re great for cooking ""anything that you want crispy"", says Jakub. Kale chips, banana chips, panko courgettes, you name it. His favourite food for the air fryer is chicken legs or thighs: after 20 minutes you get something that's ""perfectly juicy inside"" with a skin that is so crispy it ""shatters like glass"".

4. It's healthier than deep-fat frying

""Compared to deep-fat frying it is obviously healthier because it has lower fat content,"" says Jakub. But it can also be healthier than cooking with a conventional oven. If your potatoes are sitting in oil then they will absorb it as they cook. With the air fryer it’s all in the perforated basket: ""If there is any excess fat it will drip to the bottom and you don't have to eat it.""

There remain healthier ways to cook but ""the perk of an air fryer is that it often has additional functions to the air frying function,"" says Anya Gilbert, senior digital reviews writer at BBC Good Food Magazine. You can often grill or steam instead, both without using oil at all.

5. There's a huge range of prices and functions between models

The range of different air fryers on the market is vast. ""They’re getting more and more versatile as well,"" says Anya. ""Some of the newest models from brands like Ninja have about 15 functions.""

BBC Good Food Magazine recently published its 14 best air fryers of 2022, rating models across a whole range of categories. ""Cosori as a brand came out really well as best value standard size but also best for affordability in general,"" says Anya. Their 4.3 litre model retails at £79. However, it's possible to spend a whole lot more. ""The Ninja Foodi MAX Health Grill & Air Fryer was a really highly rated model,” says Anya. ""It's around £249, but it has a few bells and whistles. For example, an integrated meat thermometer.""","Can cooking with an air fryer save you money?

UK house prices fall for first time in six months,"House prices fell in March for the first time in six months, according to the latest data from Halifax.

The lender said prices dropped by 1% last month, with higher mortgage rates affecting affordability for prospective buyers.

The average house price fell by about £2,900 to £288,430.

However, Halifax said that house prices were still ahead of where they were last year.

Prices were 0.3% higher in March from a year earlier, although that was down from the 1.6% annual increase seen in February.

Kim Kinnaird, director of Halifax Mortgages, said the monthly fall in prices between February and March was ""not entirely unexpected particularly in view of the reset the market has been going through since interest rates began to rise sharply in 2022"".

""Despite this house prices have shown surprising resilience in the face of significantly higher borrowing costs,"" she said.

“Affordability constraints continue to be a challenge for prospective buyers, while existing homeowners on cheaper fixed-term deals are yet to feel the full effect of higher interest rates.""

Halifax's findings echo rival lender Nationwide, which earlier this week also reported a fall in house prices during March.

Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, said rising mortgage rates had ""finally taken a toll on the housing market"".

""Through February we had the price momentum of buyers who’d already agreed cheaper mortgages in January. Now that’s petering out, and prices have fallen,"" she said.

UK interest rates hit record lows during the Covid pandemic, but the Bank of England began raising rates at the end of 2021 as it sought to keep control of inflation - the rate at which prices rise.

This had a knock-on effect on mortgage rates which also began to increase, making it more expensive to borrow money for buying a house.

Mortgage rates peaked last summer and began to fall as expectations grew that the Bank of England will start to cut interest rates this year.

This led to a pick-up in activity in the housing market and February saw the highest number of mortgage approvals since September 2022, according to Bank of England data released earlier this week.

However, doubts about whether the Bank of England will reduce rates as quickly as some had expected has stalled cuts to mortgage rates, and some lenders have pushed them back up.

""The housing market remains sensitive to the scale and pace of interest rate changes, and with only a modest improvement in affordability on the horizon, this will likely limit the scope for significant house price increases this year,"" said Ms Kinnaird.

Halifax's house price data is based on its own mortgage lending, which does not include buyers who purchase homes with cash, or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales.","UK house prices fall for first time in six months House prices fell in March for the first time in six months, according to the latest data from Halifax.

Could getting some houseplants improve your health?,"Most of us know that air pollution caused by traffic is bad for our health. But the reality is that indoor air pollution can be just as bad – both at work and in our own homes. It’s been linked to a range of health problems, like asthma, wheezing, conjunctivitis and eczema.

Studies show that plants really can improve our wellbeing, leading to a boost in mood, memory and productivity.

The most concerning air pollutants that researchers have looked at are volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, which can be found in fire retardants, aerosol sprays and cleaning products. One such compound is limonene, which we might know by its delicious citrus scent. Unfortunately, it reacts with the ozone in the air to form the potentially dangerous chemical formaldehyde!

Another chemical where high levels can cause problems is carbon dioxide, resulting in poor concentration and decision making. Ventilating areas well can help with both these things, but where that’s not possible, houseplants are a surprisingly good and natural way to purify the air.

A green solution?

The suggestion that house plants could help with air quality came from an unlikely source. In 1989, the space agency NASA showed that houseplants could significantly lower levels of VOCs and CO2 in the air in a sealed chamber. What was lacking, was the proof they could work in our own homes or offices. It did encourage a wave of research into plants’ potential to absorb chemicals, and since then, research has taken off looking at their impact in different – more realistic – living environments. One study, for example, suggested that introducing potted plants to 60 offices with high levels of volatile organic compounds reduced levels of these compounds by between 50 and 75%.

One study in Norway assessed the impact of introducing plants to an office or school and the radiology department of a hospital and found that filling the office with houseplants led to fewer coughs, headaches and fatigue.

Less stress and better productivity

In addition to making you feel physically better, there have been claims that having indoor plants can be good for your mind too. If you’re already a plant lover, you may notice yourself feeling more comfortable, breathing in more deeply and feeling the benefits of the calming effect of nature - and there has been research which supports this. Studies show that plants really can improve our wellbeing, leading to a boost in mood, memory and productivity. One even found that when employees were able to view plants from their desk, they performed better in a specific test of concentration by 19%.

How do they help?

Dr Tijana Blanusa from the Royal Horticultural Society has been studying the ways plants improve air quality. She explains that there are several ways plants can work to remove compounds from the air. On the underside of the leaf, there are pores called stomata that let the air in, and water vapour out. A lot of gaseous compounds are removed though this pathway, while at the same time, water vapour causes our air to become more humid. Another way is through the soil, where microorganisms break down the compounds.","Could getting some houseplants improve your health?

Are weeds more important than we realise?,"Urban botanist Sophie first did this in her home country of France and has continued chalking names in London.

Can cooking with an air fryer save you money?,"Because an air fryer's fan is more powerful and the compartment is smaller, the whole device is more efficient, says Jakub. ""If I have a chicken thigh, I will probably cook it for 20 minutes in an air fryer. In an oven it would take longer."" Also, it takes longer to pre-heat a larger, conventional oven.

Because an air fryer's fan is more powerful and the compartment is smaller, the whole device is more efficient. Dr Jakub Radzikowski, Imperial College London

However, because the drawer in an air fryer has less capacity, you can only cook smaller amounts. ""If you're cooking for four people or six people the kind of time saving doesn't work anymore because you have to cook in a few batches in the air fryer,"" says the food scientist.

3. An air fryer is great for 'crispy' foods

Marketing images for air fryers often feature chicken and chips. This is because they’re great for cooking ""anything that you want crispy"", says Jakub. Kale chips, banana chips, panko courgettes, you name it. His favourite food for the air fryer is chicken legs or thighs: after 20 minutes you get something that's ""perfectly juicy inside"" with a skin that is so crispy it ""shatters like glass"".

4. It's healthier than deep-fat frying

""Compared to deep-fat frying it is obviously healthier because it has lower fat content,"" says Jakub. But it can also be healthier than cooking with a conventional oven. If your potatoes are sitting in oil then they will absorb it as they cook. With the air fryer it’s all in the perforated basket: ""If there is any excess fat it will drip to the bottom and you don't have to eat it.""

There remain healthier ways to cook but ""the perk of an air fryer is that it often has additional functions to the air frying function,"" says Anya Gilbert, senior digital reviews writer at BBC Good Food Magazine. You can often grill or steam instead, both without using oil at all.

5. There's a huge range of prices and functions between models

The range of different air fryers on the market is vast. ""They’re getting more and more versatile as well,"" says Anya. ""Some of the newest models from brands like Ninja have about 15 functions.""

BBC Good Food Magazine recently published its 14 best air fryers of 2022, rating models across a whole range of categories. ""Cosori as a brand came out really well as best value standard size but also best for affordability in general,"" says Anya. Their 4.3 litre model retails at £79. However, it's possible to spend a whole lot more. ""The Ninja Foodi MAX Health Grill & Air Fryer was a really highly rated model,” says Anya. ""It's around £249, but it has a few bells and whistles. For example, an integrated meat thermometer.""","Can cooking with an air fryer save you money? Because an air fryer's fan is more powerful and the compartment is smaller, the whole device is more efficient, says Jakub. ""If I have a chicken thigh, I will probably cook it for 20 minutes in an air fryer. In an oven it would take longer."" Also, it takes longer to pre-heat a larger, conventional oven.

Because an air fryer's fan is more powerful and the compartment is smaller, the whole device is more efficient. Dr Jakub Radzikowski, Imperial College London

However, because the drawer in an air fryer has less capacity, you can only cook smaller amounts. ""If you're cooking for four people or six people the kind of time saving doesn't work anymore because you have to cook in a few batches in the air fryer,"" says the food scientist.

3. An air fryer is great for 'crispy' foods

Marketing images for air fryers often feature chicken and chips. This is because they’re great for cooking ""anything that you want crispy"", says Jakub. Kale chips, banana chips, panko courgettes, you name it. His favourite food for the air fryer is chicken legs or thighs: after 20 minutes you get something that's ""perfectly juicy inside"" with a skin that is so crispy it ""shatters like glass"".

4. It's healthier than deep-fat frying

""Compared to deep-fat frying it is obviously healthier because it has lower fat content,"" says Jakub. But it can also be healthier than cooking with a conventional oven. If your potatoes are sitting in oil then they will absorb it as they cook. With the air fryer it’s all in the perforated basket: ""If there is any excess fat it will drip to the bottom and you don't have to eat it.""

10 ways to give your garden a spruce-up this spring,"Make sure your grass is actively growing before giving the mower a run around. Ideally there will be between two and three inches of growth, to avoid injuring the grass and any infection of the roots.

Choose a dry day and give your mower blades a sharpen-up first.

Neatening up the edges will also make a huge difference so, if you don’t have a strimmer, use a spade to sharpen the border edges, or grab some large scissors, get down on your hands and knees and get snipping!","10 ways to give your garden a spruce-up this spring Make sure your grass is actively growing before giving the mower a run around.

Could getting some houseplants improve your health?,"Most of us know that air pollution caused by traffic is bad for our health. But the reality is that indoor air pollution can be just as bad – both at work and in our own homes. It’s been linked to a range of health problems, like asthma, wheezing, conjunctivitis and eczema.

Studies show that plants really can improve our wellbeing, leading to a boost in mood, memory and productivity.

The most concerning air pollutants that researchers have looked at are volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, which can be found in fire retardants, aerosol sprays and cleaning products. One such compound is limonene, which we might know by its delicious citrus scent. Unfortunately, it reacts with the ozone in the air to form the potentially dangerous chemical formaldehyde!

Another chemical where high levels can cause problems is carbon dioxide, resulting in poor concentration and decision making. Ventilating areas well can help with both these things, but where that’s not possible, houseplants are a surprisingly good and natural way to purify the air.

A green solution?

The suggestion that house plants could help with air quality came from an unlikely source. In 1989, the space agency NASA showed that houseplants could significantly lower levels of VOCs and CO2 in the air in a sealed chamber. What was lacking, was the proof they could work in our own homes or offices. It did encourage a wave of research into plants’ potential to absorb chemicals, and since then, research has taken off looking at their impact in different – more realistic – living environments. One study, for example, suggested that introducing potted plants to 60 offices with high levels of volatile organic compounds reduced levels of these compounds by between 50 and 75%.

One study in Norway assessed the impact of introducing plants to an office or school and the radiology department of a hospital and found that filling the office with houseplants led to fewer coughs, headaches and fatigue.

Less stress and better productivity

In addition to making you feel physically better, there have been claims that having indoor plants can be good for your mind too. If you’re already a plant lover, you may notice yourself feeling more comfortable, breathing in more deeply and feeling the benefits of the calming effect of nature - and there has been research which supports this. Studies show that plants really can improve our wellbeing, leading to a boost in mood, memory and productivity. One even found that when employees were able to view plants from their desk, they performed better in a specific test of concentration by 19%.

How do they help?

Dr Tijana Blanusa from the Royal Horticultural Society has been studying the ways plants improve air quality. She explains that there are several ways plants can work to remove compounds from the air. On the underside of the leaf, there are pores called stomata that let the air in, and water vapour out. A lot of gaseous compounds are removed though this pathway, while at the same time, water vapour causes our air to become more humid. Another way is through the soil, where microorganisms break down the compounds.","Could getting some houseplants improve your health?

Are weeds more important than we realise?,"Urban botanist Sophie first did this in her home country of France and has continued chalking names in London.

Weeds have roles in ecology. They have a role for insects, urban biodiversity, they may be able to capture some pollution, they produce oxygen, they can help us understand our local environment better.

Paving the way since 1 January 2017, France banned pesticides in public spaces (apart from sports grounds and cemeteries) and now embraces its wildflowers and plants, even encouraging residents to sow seeds in the pavement cracks and walls.

Sophie was inspired to bring the same mentality to the UK and launched the More Than Weeds project this year to help us embrace our urban biodiversity in walls, pavements and tree pits to ‘rewild’ the cities.

She explains “I wanted to convey the message that possibly those plants might be more than just weeds. They have roles in ecology, they have a role for insects, urban biodiversity, they may be able to capture some pollution, they produce oxygen, they can help us understand our local environment better.”","Are weeds more important than we realise?
